# SUICalc
SUICalc is a redesign project and a strong candidate to be a nice replacement for standard iOS Calculator. I've started this, to learn SwiftUI which is quite popular in these days.

SwiftUI is the newest UI definition language in Apple's World todays. it came along with XCode 11 and started a storm between swifty communities. it seems still need more time to have a proper convention but i started to learn this new syntax. it makes most of things easier than storyboards.

i will keep continue to work with this project asap, if i make a break from my daily jobs. Here is some tips from my mind..


## KaTeX

You can render LaTeX mathematical expressions using [KaTeX](https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/):

The *Gamma function* satisfying $\Gamma(n) = (n-1)!\quad\forall n\in\mathbb N$ is via the Euler integral

$$
\Gamma(z) = \int_0^\infty t^{z-1}e^{-t}dt\,.
$$
